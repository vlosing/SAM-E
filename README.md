# SAM-E
This is the code of the Self-Adjusting Memory Ensemble (SAM-E). At the moment it is integrated in this adapted [MOA](https://github.com/vlosing/moa) repository, which can be easily build using Intelli-J.

The data sets used in the experiments are available [here](https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets).
